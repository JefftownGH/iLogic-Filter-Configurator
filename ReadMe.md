# iLogic Filter Configurator

iLogic Dialog Extension Sample - AU 2019 Germany

Project - iLogic Filter Configurator - is the source code for the iLogic extension "iLogic Filter Configurator.DLL" as part of the Vault "PDMC-Sample".
You should find the DLL in $\Libraries\iLogic\Extensions. The assembly "W091902-00.iam" (linked to task T-00001) references it.

Project - iLogic Form 1 - is a prototype demonstrating the option of using WPF dialogs for iLogic Extensions instead of Windows Forms. 
There is no corresponding iLogic Model/Rule available; refer to the sample rule as part of this project to get insight how to reference and call this type from iLogic.
